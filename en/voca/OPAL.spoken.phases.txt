a (little) bit more about 
a (whole) range of 
a (whole) series of 
a bit like 
a certain amount of 
a function of 
a group of 
a kind of 
a little bit (of) 
a little bit about 
a number of 
a sense of 
a sort of 
a variety of 
a very important 
a way of 
according to 
all kinds of 
all right 
all right so 
all sorts 
all sorts of 
an awful lot of 
an example of 
an idea of 
and all the rest of it 
and so on (and so forth) 
and things like that 
(and) you can see that 
Are there any questions? 
as a result (of) 
as a whole 
as I said 
as I say 
as it were 
as opposed to 
as to 
as well as 
as you can see 
as you know 
at that point 
at the beginning/start (of) 
at the bottom of 
at the end (of) 
at the level of 
at the same time 
at the top of 
at this point 
at this stage 
back to that 
be looking at 
because of 
been talking about 
but in fact 
by the end of 
by the way 
come back to (that) 
et cetera (et cetera) 
first of all 
for a long time 
for instance 
for the moment 
for those of you 
from the point of view of 
go back to (that) 
go on to 
going to be talking about 
going to give you an example 
going to go into 
going to go through 
going to look at 
going to say 
going to show you 
going to talk about 
(going to) come to 
have to look at 
here we have 
I (just) want to 
I suppose 
I think (that) 
I want to talk about/look at/say 
I was going to/we are going to 
I was talking about 
I would like to 
I would say 
if you like 
if you remember 
if you think about (it) 
if you think about it 
if you/we look at 
in a minute 
in a moment 
in a sense 
in a way 
in a way that 
in front of you 
in order to 
in particular 
in relation to 
in some way 
in some ways 
in such a way 
in terms of 
in the case of 
in the first place 
in the form of 
in the future 
in the same way 
in the sense (that) 
in the way that 
in this course 
in this/that case 
in this/that way 
(in) the context of 
interested in 
involved in 
is important to 
it seems to me (that) 
just going to 
(just) to remind you 
later on 
let me just 
like this 
look at this 
(lots and) lots of 
many of you 
may or may not 
may well be 
more and more 
more likely to 
more or less 
most of you 
move on to 
(not only) but also 
nothing to do with 
of course 
of some kind 
OK now 
OK so 
on the basis of 
on the board 
on the one hand 
on the other hand 
on the whole 
on the/your handout 
one of the key 
one of the most 
one of the reasons 
one of the things 
or something like that 
or whatever 
period of time 
(quite) a lot (of) 
rather than 
right so 
so that 
so we have 
so you can see 
so you get 
(so) for example 
(so) in other words 
some kind of 
some sort of 
something like 
something to do with 
such as 
tend to be 
that is to say 
the basis of 
the development of 
the difference between 
the effect(s) of 
the fact that 
the first thing (that) 
the idea is that 
the idea of 
the idea that 
the importance of 
the issue of 
the kinds of 
the level of 
the majority of 
the meaning of 
the most important 
the nature of 
the notion of 
the number of 
the other way round 
the point is that 
the possibility of 
the problem of 
the problem with 
the process of 
the question is 
the question of 
the rate of (change) 
the reason for 
the reason why 
the relationship between 
the role of 
the same sort of 
the same thing 
the sort of thing 
the sorts of 
the state of 
the type of 
the way that 
the whole of 
(the) way(s) in which 
these sorts of 
this idea of 
this/that kind of (thing) 
this/that sort of (thing) 
to bear in mind 
to deal with 
to do with 
to find out 
to see how 
to show you 
to some extent 
to think about 
to work out 
types of 
we can see 
we know that 
we looked at 
we talk about 
we talked about 
we were talking about 
we/you need to know 
What do you think…? 
What does that mean? 
what happens if 
what happens to 
what I mean 
what I mean by 
what I want to do 
when it comes to 
when we/you look at 
Why do you think…? 
with respect to 
you can imagine 
you can look at 
you can see here 
you find that 
you might say 
you might want to (look at) 
you will find 
you will see
