My name Thuan, as you know. I have been senior coder,  Software Architect. About Software Architect, nowadays, we have many patterns, but have two essensial perspective, approach:
1. Following OOP, Object Oriented Programming which C++ is the famous and chief representive.
2. Unix Philosophy, or KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid from US Naval) which C is the blockbuster of this.
Each of them has a dark side. For example: if you know Linus Toward, Richard Stallman talked about C++ and OOP. It makes C++ programmer sweated.

However, they have been existing and key languages. Open mind makes us easy to work with any language. That's my thought, just be a drop in ocean.
